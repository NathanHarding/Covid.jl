# Train the Model

We estimate parameters for transition probabilities and conditional duration distributions from the literature and from DHHS linked data.

We estimate the probabilities that make up the baseline policies by training the model for the period 25th Jan to 23rd Mar inclusive.
This baseline period includes restrictions on overseas arrivals, but otherwise excludes Stage 1/2/3 restrictions.
On the other hand many people were working from home and/or self-isolating before 23/3.
